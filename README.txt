IRduino

IRduino is a Mac/Windows cross-platform system to utilize an Arduino 
with IR TV remotes to control XBMC by mapping their buttons to keystrokes.
For the time being, this is a rather inefficient process of logging codes
by copy and pasting, but, as this is a learning experience, I hope to soon
incorporate.
